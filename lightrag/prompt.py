PROMPTS["entity_extraction"] = """-Goal-
You are an expert at extracting entities and relationships from policy documents for the King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC). Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
Use {language} as output language. (Ignore, and don't use the content text if you don't understand the language)

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.
Format the content-level key words as ("content_keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)

4. Return output in {language} as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

File Name: Employee Exposure and Post Exposure Management POLINC-20R10.pdf
Document Number: POLINC-20 (note: remove the revision number in everything (example: POLINC-20R10 -> POLINC-20))
Document Title: Sharps and Contamination Incident Report
Originating Entity: nan nan infection contorl

Content:
# I. Purpose:
To prevent and / or minimize the spread of communicable diseases among KHCC employees.
# II. Policy:
2.1 Employees exposed to any patient with suspected or proven communicable disease at KHCC shall report to the infection control program and the employee health clinic.
2.2 Any employee who gets exposed to blood or body fluids through mucosal membranes, needle or other sharp exposure, shall report in at the time of incidence (maximum within 24 hours) to the employee health clinic and be evaluated and offered standard medical care aimed at preventing or minimizing the risk of infection associated with the exposure.
2.3 In case of weekend or after working hours, employees shall report to triage room.
# III. Scope:
This policy aims to protect all KHCC employees from getting infected with a blood borne pathogen in addition to providing the employees with post exposure standard care.
# IV. Responsibilities:
It is the responsibility of the employee health clinic physician and the infection control program to assure the delivery of the optimal care to all employees when required. It is the responsibility of the exposed employee to report the exposure if needed laboratory tests for the source of exposure will be ordered by employee health physician
# V. Definitions:
Communicable disease: Illness that is caused by an organism or micro-organism or its toxic products that can potentially be transmitted directly or indirectly from an infected person, animal or environment.
# VI. Procedure:
6.1 The employee who has been exposed to a patient with suspected or proven communicable disease must report the incident to the employee health clinic (see of communicable diseases Attachment POLINC-16/Attach. A).
6.2 Exposed employees must fill out the first page of the sharp and contaminated injury report available in all nursing units/wards (see Sharps and Contamination Incident Report attachment POLINC-20/Attach. A).
6.3 Employee health physician will fill out the second page of the incident report marked “For Doctor use only”. This copy will then be filed and relevant database updated. A reportable disease may need to be communicated to the ministry of health (MOH) as per MOH regulations.

6.4 A copy of the incidence report will be given to the infection control program office, the safety office and the social security office in case of the development of actual illness related to the exposure.
6.5 It is the responsibility of the employee health clinic physician to determine the immunization status of the exposed employee. As part of the pre-employment screening and immunization, all health care workers (new and old) will be tested (unless they provide a proof of immunity/prior testing) for hepatitis B and C, HIV, PPD, and the immune status will be determined for mumps, measles, rubella and chicken pox. A record of these results will be kept in the employee's record. Consultation with the infection control physician before employment on all positive results is required.
6.6 Employee health physician will do the initial evaluation and provide the injured with standard first aid management, including cleaning, suturing and anti-tetanus as necessary. If incident occurred after regular working hours of the clinic, such evaluation and management will take place in the triage room by the triage room physician. The employee will then visit the employee health clinic on the next working day with the above form.
6.7 The employee health physician will determine the significance of the employee’s exposure to communicable diseases according to the attached criteria (see Attachment POLINC20/Attach. B) and will consult the head of infection control program if medical treatment be required.
6.8 Employee health clinic physician, in consultation with the head of the infection control program, will order the necessary lab tests and provide the appropriate post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) according to the attachment (HBV post exposure management POLINC20-Attach.E & Management o accidental exposure to communicable diseases POLINC20-Attach. C).
6.9 Pregnant health care personnel's occupational exposure will be guided by the attached guidelines (see attachment pregnant women POLINC-20-Attach.F).
6.10 Employee health physician, in consultation with the head of infection control program, will determine the work restriction required, if needed, according to the attachment (see attachment work restrictions POLINC-20-Attach.D).
# VII. Documentation Requirements:
Copy of laboratory investigation results required by the employee health physician must be kept in the employee file in human resources department and employee health clinic.
